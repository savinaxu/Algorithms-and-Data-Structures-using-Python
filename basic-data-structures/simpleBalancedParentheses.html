    <h1>3.6. Simple Balanced Parentheses<a class="headerlink" href="#simple-balanced-parentheses"
            title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
    <p>We now turn our attention to using stacks to solve real computer science
        problems. You have no doubt written arithmetic expressions such as</p>
    <p><span class="math">\((5+6)*(7+8)/(4+3)\)</span></p>
    <p>where parentheses are used to order the performance of operations. You
        may also have some experience programming in a language such as Lisp
        with constructs like</p>
    <div class="highlight-default">
        <div class="highlight">
            <pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">defun</span> <span class="n">square</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
     <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>This defines a function called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">square</span></code> that will
        return the square of
        its argument <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span></code>. Lisp is notorious for using lots
        and lots of
        parentheses.</p>
    <p>In both of these examples, parentheses must appear in a balanced
        fashion. <strong>Balanced parentheses</strong> means that each opening symbol has a
        corresponding closing symbol and the pairs of parentheses are properly
        nested. Consider the following correctly balanced strings of
        parentheses:</p>
    <div class="highlight-default">
        <div class="highlight">
            <pre><span></span><span class="p">(()()()())</span>

<span class="p">(((())))</span>

<span class="p">(()((())()))</span>
</pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Compare those with the following, which are not balanced:</p>
    <div class="highlight-default">
        <div class="highlight">
            <pre><span></span><span class="p">((((((())</span>

<span class="p">()))</span>

<span class="p">(()()(()</span>
</pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>The ability to differentiate between parentheses that are correctly
        balanced and those that are unbalanced is an important part of
        recognizing many programming language structures.</p>
    <p>The challenge then is to write an algorithm that will read a string of
        parentheses from left to right and decide whether the symbols are
        balanced. To solve this problem we need to make an important
        observation. As you process symbols from left to right, the most recent
        opening parenthesis must match the next closing symbol (see
        <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-parmatch"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 4</span></a>). Also, the
        first opening symbol processed may have to
        wait until the very last symbol for its match. Closing symbols match
        opening symbols in the reverse order of their appearance; they match
        from the inside out. This is a clue that stacks can be used to solve the
        problem.</p>
    <div class="figure align-center" id="id1">
        <span id="fig-parmatch"></span><img alt="" src="../assets/images/simpleparcheck.png" />
        <p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 4: Matching Parentheses</span></p>
    </div>
    <p>Once you agree that a stack is the appropriate data structure for
        keeping the parentheses, the statement of the algorithm is
        straightforward. Starting with an empty stack, process the parenthesis
        strings from left to right. If a symbol is an opening parenthesis, push
        it on the stack as a signal that a corresponding closing symbol needs to
        appear later. If, on the other hand, a symbol is a closing parenthesis,
        pop the stack. As long as it is possible to pop the stack to match every
        closing symbol, the parentheses remain balanced. If at any time there is
        no opening symbol on the stack to match a closing symbol, the string is
        not balanced properly. At the end of the string, when all symbols have
        been processed, the stack should be empty. The Python code to implement
        this algorithm is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#lst-parcheck1"><span
                class="std std-ref">ActiveCode 1</span></a>.</p>

from pythonds.basic.stack import Stack

def parChecker(symbolString):
    s = Stack()
    balanced = True
    index = 0
    while index < len(symbolString) and balanced:
        symbol = symbolString[index]
        if symbol == "(":
            s.push(symbol)
        else:
            if s.isEmpty():
                balanced = False
            else:
                s.pop()

        index = index + 1

    if balanced and s.isEmpty():
        return True
    else:
        return False

print(parChecker('((()))'))
print(parChecker('(()'))
</textarea>
    </div>
    <p>This function, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">parChecker</span></code>, assumes that a <code
            class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Stack</span></code> class is
        available and returns a boolean result as to whether the string of
        parentheses is balanced. Note that the boolean variable <code class="docutils literal"><span
                class="pre">balanced</span></code> is
        initialized to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">True</span></code> as there is no reason to
        assume otherwise at the
        start. If the current symbol is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(</span></code>, then it is
        pushed on the stack
        (lines 9–10). Note also in line 15 that <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pop</span></code>
        simply removes a symbol
        from the stack. The returned value is not used since we know it must be
        an opening symbol seen earlier. At the end (lines 19–22), as long as the
        expression is balanced and the stack has been completely cleaned off,
        the string represents a correctly balanced sequence of parentheses.</p>
